Expense Management System
An intuitive and powerful platform designed to eliminate the friction of manual expense reporting and approvals for modern companies.

About The Project
Companies today, especially as they scale, face significant challenges with traditional expense reimbursement processes. These manual workflows are often slow, prone to human error, lack transparency, and create administrative bottlenecks for employees, managers, and finance teams alike.

This project aims to solve that problem by providing a centralized, automated, and highly flexible Expense Management System. It empowers organizations to define their unique approval hierarchies and rules, giving them complete control and visibility over expenses while making the process seamless for their employees. From simple submissions to complex, multi-step conditional approvals, this application is built to handle it all with ease.

Core Features
👤 Role-Based Access Control
The system is built on a robust role-based architecture, ensuring users only see and do what's relevant to them.

Admin: Has complete oversight. Manages users, configures company-wide approval workflows, and can view or override any expense claim.

Manager: Approves or rejects expenses submitted by their direct reports, views team spending, and participates in the approval chain.

Employee: Can quickly submit expense claims, upload receipts, and track the status of their reimbursements in real-time.

➡ Seamless Expense Submission
We make submitting expenses effortless for employees.

Multi-Currency Support: Submit expenses in any currency, which are then automatically converted to the company's default currency for approvers.

Detailed Claims: Include all necessary information such as category, date, description, and amount.

OCR for Receipts: A standout feature that allows employees to simply scan or upload a receipt. Our OCR technology automatically reads and populates the expense details, saving time and reducing manual entry errors.

⚙️ Dynamic & Conditional Approval Workflows
This is the heart of the platform. Admins can design approval workflows that perfectly match their company's internal policies.

Multi-Level Approvals: Define a clear sequence of approvers for any expense. For example, an expense can be routed from a direct Manager -> Finance Department -> Director, moving to the next step only upon approval from the current one.

Conditional Logic: Go beyond simple sequences with powerful conditional rules:

Percentage Rule: Automatically approve an expense if a certain percentage of assigned approvers (e.g., 60%) give their consent.

Specific Approver Rule: Create shortcuts where an approval from a key person (like the CFO) can override all other steps and auto-approve the claim.

Hybrid Rules: Combine multi-level and conditional logic for ultimate flexibility.

📊 Complete Transparency & History
No more guessing games. Everyone involved has clear visibility into the process.

Status Tracking: Employees can see the exact status of their submissions—whether they are pending, approved, or rejected.

Approval History: Managers and Admins can view a complete audit trail, including who approved or rejected a claim and any accompanying comments.

Centralized Dashboard: Each user gets a dashboard tailored to their role, showing pending tasks and relevant expense summaries at a glance.
